# Personal-Pokedex

Goal (from Canvas assignment page):

To create a pokemon trainer showcase website that displays information focused around 3 pokemon chosen by the student using AJAX to retrieve said data. This project is focused on client side technologies.

Styling inspired by Pokémon core game series--layout designed to look like starter Pokémon selection screen while modal styling is reminiscent of in-game Pokédex entries from border to font to color choice.

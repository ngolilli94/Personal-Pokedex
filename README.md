# Personal-Pokedex

## Goal:
To create a pokemon trainer showcase website that displays information focused around 3 pokemon chosen by the student using AJAX to retrieve said data. This project is focused on client side technologies.

Styling inspired by Pokémon core game series--layout designed to look like starter Pokémon selection screen while modal styling is reminiscent of in-game Pokédex entries from border to font to color choice. Written in HTML5, SCSS, JavaScript, & some JQuery (modals)

Special thanks to my fellow tablemates for their moral support!

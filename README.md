# Personal Pokedex

## Goal
To create a pokemon trainer showcase website that displays information focused around 3 pokemon chosen by the student using AJAX to retrieve said data. This project is focused on client side technologies.

## Summary
Styling inspired by Pokémon core game series--layout designed to look like starter Pokémon selection screen while modal styling is reminiscent of in-game Pokédex entries from border to font to color choice. 

## Deployment
Deployed to Heroku at https://elle-poketeam.herokuapp.com/index.html
